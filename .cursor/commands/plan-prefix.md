we need to create a very detailed and thurough plan for implementing the following change, this change will update how much of the project code flow works so the plan MUST include phases, sections, tasks and subtasks.
for each section there should be research tasks, implementation tasks and code-review tasks.
in the plan include the following important rules:
1. no terminal commands!
2. no stopping before all tasks are complete

at the end of the plan add a section like the previous with instruction on how to do a end to end review of the added and modified code. the plan should include review of integration between differents parts of the system, between frontend/backend, between database and code. it should look for bugs, logical errors, unwanted side-effects, common problem patterns, dead code, lack of documentation, unneccesary documentation (no need to describe how the code was before the change, all commends should only be there to help understand the current code.)
