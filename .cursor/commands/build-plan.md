Build the plan, do not modify the plan, follow the plan from the top down in order, do not stop until the plan is 100% complete and the issue is identified and remedied. even if you find a medium/high/critical error continue after fixing it there might be more bugs.
do not run any terminal commands, do not ask the user and questions, just execute the plan.
