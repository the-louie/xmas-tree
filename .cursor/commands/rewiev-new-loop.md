still finding issues. let's try this.

this is the plan that must be executed:
1. rememeber this plan until you are told to forget it, the plan is "ITERATION REVIEW"
2. run a /review-new
3. if there is ANY issues found or any criticallity go to 2
4. when the review has completed without a single issue found do a last doublechck and run a new /review-new
5. output a summary of changes made, no code, just a description
6. forget the plan
